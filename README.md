#Though Process:

1. Unsure if expected to generate a 1:1 mapping (criteria did not specify) ie. multiple inputs can have same output
2. If it was the case that a 1:1 mapping was expected, then uncommenting the code results in solving the 1:1 issue,
   except in the case of having one less output. (There is a case where the key and element cannot be used because of
   the circular relationship problem)
